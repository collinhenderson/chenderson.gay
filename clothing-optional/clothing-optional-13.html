			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 13 - Dylan</h1>
			<h2 id="about">About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places. Some places or activities require nudity. Some places require clothing. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town. Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href="mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h2 class="thanks-for-the-feedback">Thanks For The Feedback</h2>
			<p>Several people have contacted me with comments about my stories, particularly the last one. Most of them said that they liked its realism. I kinda disagree. Sex isn't like this, especially within the context of the real-world's culture. I think I just pay better attention to my writing, and I like world-building, story-building, and character development more than the other writers on this website, and that might lead people to think this is more "realistic".</p>
			<p>This is porn. Straight up. This world is just generally more open about sex, so as a product there's more people that are casual about it and have a wider range of experience, such as the characters in this story.</p>
			<p>Sex is hard. The first few times anyone has sex will be bad. Imagine putting someone who has never played the piano in front of one and asked them to play. They might be able to do simple things like the happy birthday/twinkle twinkle song, even if they have watched other people play the piano. It might take you a while for them to improve too - and that's fine, as long as they keep trying.</p>
			<p>This also applies to kissing, etc.</p>
			<p>The strawpoll results were overwhelmingly in support of this series being continued. 93⅓% (28/30) voted yes, 6⅔% (2 votes) voted no. Thank you for the support.</p>
			
			<h2 id="start-of-chapter">Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>Collin and Lucas waited in anticipation to meet Dylan. Justin and Trevor were bringing him to their second "sex club" meeting. Neither Collin nor Lucas had ever met Dylan, but they definitely knew he went to their school. He was a recognizable face. Collin recognized pretty much everyone who wasn't a freshman.</p>
			<p>Dylan would supposedly be somewhat caught up to speed on <em>why</em> he was being invited over. Collin thought that was a good idea.</p>
			<p>They were a few minutes late. That was unlike them. The door was unlocked, and they were instructed to let themselves in. They were talking kinda loudly when they came in the door. Collin and Lucas got off the couch to greet the guest. Dylan was clothed, but undressed as soon as he was inside to match everyone else. Collin deducted that Justin and/or Trevor instructed him to be naked.</p>
			<p>The two greeted and introduced themselves to Dylan. The group talked about how they all knew each other as the newcomers finished kicking off their shoes.</p>
			<p>They made small talk about sports. Dylan already knew Lucas was on the soccer team and had apparently messed around a couple of times. They talked about school a bit. Also, Justin and Dylan shared two classes. They eventually made their way to the living room. A couple more minutes of small talk ensued before Dylan interrupted it. He apologized and asked if they could discuss what he was there about.</p>
			<p>"It's more or less what you think it is," Justin said.</p>
			<p>"You just... have sex?"</p>
			<p>"Well, it's slightly more than that. We try to be friends first," Collin said. "And there's a rule set."</p>
			<p>"What are the rules?"</p>
			<p>Collin struggled to remember as he recited. He only looked at them once after he wrote them down. He rephrased:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All members consent to sex with one-another provided it's in private and safe</li>
				<li>Any new member must be approved by all current members</li>
				<li>Any new member must do anal both ways with all current members to completion</li>
				<li>Members can boss around another member who is more off a bottom than them.</li>
				<li>Pictures and videos may be taken as long as it is never shared with anyone who isn't a member</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Dylan digested the rules. It was a lot to process. He had never even heard of  a group like this.</p>
			<p>"Any questions?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"How often are your meetings?"</p>
			<p>"We don't have a schedule, and this is only the second official meeting."</p>
			<p>"And I assume it's only you four?"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>Dylan nodded.</p>
			<p>"So," Justin started to inquire, "would you be interested in joining?"</p>
			<p>"Woah," Dylan said "I do <em>not</em> have enough information to make that decision."</p>
			<p>Justin gave a humbling smile, "Sorry, we haven't done this before."</p>
			<p>Dylan shyly smiled back, "It sounds fun, but I <em>would</em> like to get to know you all better first."</p>
			<p>"What would you like to know?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"What you guys' interests are, your hobbies, that sort of stuff."</p>
			<p>"Actually," Lucas pointed his left pointer finger upward, "I have an idea, for each question you ask, the person who answers gets to ask Dylan a question."</p>
			<p>Everyone, including Dylan, was down for that.</p>
			<p>There were now stakes to asking a question, so Dylan had to choose carefully. He eventually asked Trevor, "What's your favorite sport."</p>
			<p>"Um... It would probably be soccer. About how often are you naked?"</p>
			<p>Dylan immediately understood what was going on here. The other four boys wanted to get to know him more sexually than personally. The one-for-one questioning was their way to get that information out of him. He reminded himself that he could leave if he didn't like it. He didn't drive himself here, but he trusted that Justin would drive him home if he asked. Or he could call a cab.</p>
			<p>"I'd say about half the day. Mostly when I swim."</p>
			<p>Dylan stalled as he chose his next question. He really just wanted to know these guys' hobbies, but could only ask one thing at a time. He could ask multiple questions but he assumed he would have to answer multiple. "What's your favorite hobby?" he asked nobody in particular.</p>
			<p>Lucas answered, "playing soccer."</p>
			<p>"<em>Okay</em> I know that..." Dylan growled.</p>
			<p>"Should've asked a different question, then."</p>
			<p>Dylan was strangely enjoying this. It felt like things were going to fast. He had just met two of the four about ten minutes ago, and they were already coaxing him into giving up sexual details of his life. Was he enjoying it too much?</p>
			<p>"How often do you have sex or masturbate?" Lucas asked his question.</p>
			<p>"I masturbate about once every other day. Sex is monthly, maybe. Typically less."</p>
			<p>Lucas nodded.</p>
			<p>"Alright," Dylan continued, "Collin, what is your favorite hobby?"</p>
			<p>Collin didn't really have any hobbies. "Playing video games, I guess. What would you describe your sexuality as?"</p>
			<p>"Gay."</p>
			<p>Collin couldn't stop staring at Dylan's penis. He was sitting with his legs slightly open. His shaft reached all the way down to the couch, and had to bend a little bit to fit. It was girthy too. His pubic hair was thick and pure black. Just the thought that Dylan might be a part of his club, and being able to fuck him at whim, turned him on so much. He started to get hard.</p>
			<p>Dylan had his next question lined up this time, "Justin, what's your idea of a fun night?"</p>
			<p>"Smoking weed, playing loud music, and fucking someone. What's <em>your</em> idea of a fun night?"</p>
			<p>"Doing laps by myself."</p>
			<p>Dylan paused before asking his next question, "Trevor, why are cheesy burritos your favorite food?"</p>
			<p>Trevor shrugged, "I like cheese, and the fiber is good. What's your weirdest fetish?"</p>
			<p>"Oh boy, that's a personal question. Probably rape, though."</p>
			<p>Collin would love to be raped by that dick. He was so turned on. He was now fully erect.</p>
			<p>"Collin, when was the last time you lied?"</p>
			<p>"My parents called me last week while I was screwing Lucas. I lied about what I was doing."</p>
			<p>Dylan chuckled. This was beginning to grow on him.</p>
			<p>"Can I suck your dick?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>Okay, it hadn't grown on him <em>that</em> much, but he said, "Sure, why not." He figured there was no point to saying no. He might as well get a blowjob when he was around people who wouldn't care.</p>
			<p>With a pep, Collin went over to Dylan and got on his knees, sitting on his feet. He picked up Dylan's shaft and started to stroke it. He also got himself going a bit. He started to lick the tip.</p>
			<p>Dylan continued to ask questions, "So how long has this been going?"</p>
			<p>Justin elected himself to answer, "A little over a month. We've met about once a week." Justin took a moment to think of his question, "when was the first time you had sex?"</p>
			<p>"February 14th, 2019," Dylan answered.</p>
			<p>Collin moved onto fully sucking Dylan. His member was only slightly bigger when erect. Nonetheless, Collin couldn't fit half of it in his mouth without activating his gag reflex. He adapted and took some turns licking the base of the shaft. He also caressed Dylan's testicles. Dylan loved this.</p>
			<p>"How do you guys decide when to meet?"</p>
			<p>Justin answered again, "We have a group chat and decide on a time there, but we usually just meet on Saturday afternoons."</p>
			<p>Dylan nodded.</p>
			<p>Justin asked his question: "what's your favorite position?"</p>
			<p>Dylan raised his eyebrows, "I... don't think I have one, but I do like being on top." he reached his right hand down and placed it on Collin's shoulder. He felt around Colin's skin.</p>
			<p>Dylan no longer wanted to ask any questions, and so he didn't. After a while the other boys realized the questioning had ended, and finally started to pleasure themselves. Justin grabbed Trevor and forced him to reveal his butt. Justin rubbed his erection on Tevor's crack. Lucas started masturbating.</p>
			<p>Collin removed himself from Dylan's dick and looked up at him, "Can you fuck me?" he begged.</p>
			<p>Dylan could barely believe that this twink that he met fifteen minutes ago was begging to be fucked by him. "Absolutely," Dylan smiled.</p>
			<p>Collin changed to doggie position on the floor. He stuck his butt up in the air. Dylan got behind Collin once he was in position. Dylan immediately pushed his boner into Collin's butt. Collin breathed heavily as it was inserted. Dylan stopped halfway, and started thrusting.</p>
			<p>Justin pushed Trevor down onto his back on the couch. He then pushed himself into Trevor</p>
			<p>Lucas kept stroking himself. After a bit, he curled his legs back and started to  finger his hole.</p>
			<p>The motions continued for a while, the grunting along with it. Dylan loved this. </p>
			<p>Collin loved it too. Dylan was so big. He hadn't been stretched like this in a while. It was the biggest dick he'd taken. Dylan had eventually gotten all the way in.</p>
			<p>It was kind of painful for Collin, but the pleasure overrode that. He relaxed and the pain lessened.</p>
			<p>Dylan was the first to orgasm. He pulled out and erupted all over Collin's back and butt. He inserted himself back into Collin gently, pushing some cum in along with it.</p>
			<p>Justin was next. He also pulled out and ejaculated all over Trevor.</p>
			<p>Once Dylan was done with Collin, he moved over to where Lucas was on the couch. He climbed over Lucas and inserted himself into him. He correctly assumed Lucas would be cool with being fucked. The bottom moaned obnoxiously loud. Collin laid his head on the floor with his butt up like Trevor usually does. He could feel a tiny bit of liquid flowing inside him.</p>
			<p>Trevor was next to orgasm. He ejaculated all over his belly. Some got on his face, some on the couch.</p>
			<p>Finally, Lucas finished, releasing all over his belly and chest.</p>
			<p>Dylan didn't stop thrusting. The other three boys watched and judged Dylan as he fucked Lucas. He clearly wasn't experienced. But he also, albeit less clearly, knew how to pleasure his partner. He changed each thrust a bit based on how Lucas responded.</p>
