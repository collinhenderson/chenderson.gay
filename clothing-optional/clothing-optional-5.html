			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 05 - The Beach (Interlude)</h1>
			<h2>About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places, and it is somewhat expected for no clothing to be worn in certain places/activities such as swimming and sports. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town.
Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story (except for interludes like this one) there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href="mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>What's an Interlude?</h2>
			<p>So I realized that a majority, no matter how small, will always be able to outvote the minority, completely leaving them unsatisfied (in some way). So my solution is to periodically publish first-person "interludes" that are shorter than the normal chapters, and contain sex with the lesser-voted boy. They are still important to the plot</p>

			<h2>Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>There's a certain feeling when you really look at someone's naked body.</p>
			<p>Like, I have literally never seen Trevor wearing any clothing, but for some reason, right at this second, he somehow feels really naked and exposed.</p>
			<p>I don't know why. Maybe it's just a run-of-the-mill thing, or maybe because I really want to screw him. I don't know.</p>
			<p>I wonder if there's anyone thinking something like that about me.</p>
			<p>"You'll finally have a normal tan." Trevor said, turning on his side to face me. His penis flopped over to point to the ground. His testicles hung the same direction. "Liking the beach?" Trevor asked. "Yeah." I said. I was laying on my front, tanning my backside. I wrenched my head to look over at him. The light towards the west made long shadows on his body, causing a very mysterious effect. I took a visual tour of his nakedness. I started at his sharp shoulder blades, then his breasts, then rib cage, then continued down to take a long look at his penis- "My eyes are up here." Trevor said. "Oh, sorry." I said.</p>
			<p>Trevor laughed. "What?" I asked. Trevor looked at something behind me. "Common, man, I know you're gay." he said. I was surprised, but also not really surprised. "How long have you known?" I asked. "For a couple years." Trevor said.</p>
			<p>I was again, surprised, but not really surprised.</p>
			<p>Trevor looked me in the eyes, "So," he said, "Wanna fuck me?" he asserted.</p>
			<p>"...oh..." I said.</p>
			<p>"Oh?" Trevor asked.</p>
			<p>"That was... forward." I explained.</p>
			<p>"And?" Trevor said.</p>
			<p>"Point taken." I said.</p>
			<p>"So," Trevor said. A couple naked young boys ran way to close to us. Trevor paused for a second. "Do you wanna?"</p>
			<p>I pretended to sit on it for a second, "Sure." I said.</p>
			<p>Trevor smiled at me, then stood up. He turned towards Jessica for a hot second. "Watch our stuff" He told as I stood up as well. Jessica brought one giant ten foot by teen foot towel. I quickly moved my backpack back on the towel. Trevor was waiting for me right behing me. I turned around and looked slightly down at him. I quickly looked at Jessica who was messing with her phone, then back at Trevor. "Ready?" he asked. "Yeah." I responded. "Alright," he said, "Follow me, I know a place." Trevor said, he turned around and started walking north towards the cliff at the back of the beach. I followed him closely. "Where are we going?" I asked, as the sand started to burn my feet, "To a cove thing. It's just a couple minutes up, you passed by it earlier with Justin." Trevor said. Trevor looked forward. I checked out his butt.</p>
			<p>We walked for about five minutes. The amount of beach-goers decreased and decreased, until we got to a break in the beach. There were tons of rocks, and water rushed in and out of them. There was a foot bridge that started towards the back of the beach. Trevor lead me to duck under the bridge, back towards the cliff more. There was an entrance to a very big cave. The cave was mostly filled with a deep pool of seawater, but on the side there was a dirt shelf that was about eight feet wide at its biggest. "How do you know this place is here?" I asked. "Sources." Trevor kept it vague. It was no secret he hooked up a lot, he most likely knew about these places from them.</p>
			<p>"Like it?" Trevor made sure, "Yeah, it's great." I said. Trevor let me look around, "Have you ever had sex before?" Trevor asked. "Yeah, a couple times." I answered honestly.</p>
			<p>"Nice." Trevor said.</p>
			<p>"So," Trevor continued, "what do you wanna do?"<p>
			<p>"I don't know." I mumbled.</p>
			<p>Come on man. I hate deciding. It's us, and our bodies. No clothes, no phones, no other people, no limits, no judgement. So," Trevor paused again, "what do you want to do?"
			<p>My dick started started to get hard. "I don't know." I said.</p>
			<p>"C'mon, man." Trevor said, shaking his body. His penis jiggled with him, speeding along my erection. "Choose something." Trevor started to get hard as well.</p>
			<p>I went through my small catalog of sex terms. "Cowgirl?" I suggested, one that I liked."</p>
			<p>"Sure." Trevor agreed, "wanna do foreplay?" Trevor asked. "What?" I said.</p>
			<p>"Do you not know what foreplay is?" Trevor asked. "Yeah," I said, "I was just confused about that question for a second." Trevor looked at me, "Don't... Don't worry about it." I said.</p>
			<p>"Alright." Trevor said, waiting for me to get in position. I stared at him for a bit, his penis was now fully hard, and impatient. Trevor sighed, "Sit with your back leaning up against that." Trevor said, pointing to a fairly (but not entirely) vertical part of the side of the cave. I obliged at sat down there. The dirt was rough against my butt. I spread my legs in a V, Trevor sat on his feet. His butt cheeks squished out of the way. Trevor looked at me. My erect penis rested up against my chest.</p>
			<p>Trevor looked at me. "You okay?" Trevor must've noticed something. "I don't know it's just... Sex with with one of my best friends in a cave." I pointed out. "Ah." Trevor said, "This is normal, you'll get used to it."</p>
			<p>"Um, okay." I said.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," Trevor said, "I know."</p>
			<p>"Anyway, wanna get on with this?" Trevor asked. "Yeah?" I asked/answered.</p>
			<p>Trevor scotched towards me, slowly moved each leg over mine and then put each hand on the upper part of my arm, he stayed almost half-standing. My penis was now painfully hard. Trevor was hovering above my pelvic region. I looked up at him, then started to look down His breasts were cute and complemented his slender body His penis was right in my face, sticking straight up in the air, and swayed slightly with his movements. I shifted slightly, and rested my arms on his waist. I looked back up at him. "Ready?" he asked. "Yeah." I answered, almost mesmerized.</p>
			<p>Trevor reached his right hand in front of him, and moved my penis to line up with him. Trevor looked slightly up, trying to focus, as he lowered himself on me. My chest started to explode. Finally, I penetrated him. Trevor sighed slightly. Trevor looked down at me again, and put his hand back on my arm. "Still okay?" Trevor asked. "Yes, keep going." I told him.</p>
			<p>Trevor kept lowering himself down, until he had taken in two inches. The inside of him was tight, as expected, and just warm enough. The whole thing was slightly painful too. I started to push Trevor up and down. My penis slid in and out of him. Trevor kept pushing himself slightly more and more downward with each rotation. He reached a point where he let out an extremely sexual groan.</p>
			<p>Trevor looked directly in my eyes. Eventually, Trevor had taken on four and a half inches out of five. My body was enveloped with both physical and emotional pleasure.</p>
			<p>The feeling started to get stronger and stronger. I kept my right hand on his waist. and used my left to push Trevor's body towards mine. Trevor kissed me. The emotional pleasure was overwhelming. The physical sensation followed soon after - I orgasmed. I kept kissing Trevor. I kept fucking Trevor. I came.</p>
			<p>My cum acted as a lubricant, and made Trevor feel more pleasure, which pushed him to the breaking point. He orgasmed and game over both of our chests. A few seconds after he was done, Trevor stopped kissing me, and rested all the way down on my penis.</p>
			<p>Trevor looked into my eyes. I put both hands as firmly on his butt cheeks as I could. I could feel my cum running out of his hole.</p>
