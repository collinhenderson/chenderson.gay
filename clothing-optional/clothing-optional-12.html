			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 12 - Weed</h1>
			<p>This chapter includes the following uncommon themes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scat</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="about">About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places. Some places or activities require nudity. Some places require clothing. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town. Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href="mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h2 id="its-been-a-while">It"s Been A While</h2>
			<p>So it"s been about a year and a half since I"ve written a chapter. That"s a long time.</p>
			<p>I have plenty of other writing projects that I maintain across other identities. From all that experience, I"ve found that whenever I can"t write for an extended period of time it"s due to one of two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I am very satisfied with my published work.</li>
				<li>I am very unsatisfied with my published work.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is definitely a case of the second one. My last story was... somehow both bland and grotesque. There was almost no emotional sustenance. It was just sex. There was barely any plot development either.</p>
			<p>The earlier stores are also kind of rough. I"m re-reading them to make sure I maintain continuity. My writing style is like, horrible. It reads like I"m cooking a meal and landing a plane while writing it. I"ll break some consistency on information from the earlier stories just to try and stay interesting. I already have anyway. I"ll still try to keep it consistent from this point onwards. I get this is porn but that doesn"t mean consistency and good writing style don"t matter. In fact, I hate that porn tends to have bad writing.</p>
			<p>My angst is amplified with the guro story I made. I will not be linking it here. If you <em><strong>really</strong></em> want to read it, email me.</p>
			<p>I"ve actually had some of the same concerns I do now whilst writing previous chapters. I just kind of gave up instead of trying to power through. I"m going to try one more time to make this series interesting.</p>
			<p>I actually wrote most of "this" chapter already, but I"m going to rewrite it in order to be thorough.</p>
			<p>I"ll start the straw polls again. This time, instead of asking which character you"d want to see more of and/or some other question, I"m going to ask if this series should continue or not. A simple yes or no question. The link is available at the end of the chapter. Please only vote if you read the chapter.</p>
			
			<h2 id="start-of-chapter">Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>Collin couldn"t decide where to put the photos and videos from the "meeting" yesterday. He certainly didn"t want to put anything sexual inside is regular photo library, nor did he want to put something personal inside his porn library out of fear of accidentally sending it to someone. He regularly shared porn with his anonymous online friends.</p>
			<p>Collin had fallen asleep with Lucas before he had a chance to organize the photos, so he was doing it now, mid morning the next day.</p>
			<p>Collin opted to make a whole new location outside his regular porn folder and then organize the content in there. He figured the folder would definitely stand out among the others. He made a mental note to always check any content he shared from now on. Collin cut and pasted the photos and videos into it. He then created a new folder named "2020 09 22 - Backyard [Justin, Collin, Lucas, Trevor]" - Yesterday"s date - and moved the photos and videos into there. Then, just to be extra safe, he set the permissions of the folder so only root could access it. He definitely wouldn"t </p>
			<p>There were only seven files - two videos and five photos. He expected there to be more, but that number made sense. The boys were focused on thair activities.</p>
			<p>Collin wanted to give the files descriptive names alongside the date, so he opened the first file, which was a video. The files were already timestamped, so the file manager displayed them in chronological order.</p>
			<p>The video was of him giving Trevor a blowjob. The two were on the grass and Trever was covered in Collin"s urine. It seemed like he was purposefully showing off the more sexual parts of his body - the way he was sitting on his feet spread his butt cheeks just enough to expose his hole to the camera.</p>
			<p>The video ended with Collin nibbling at Trevor"s balls. Collin closed out of the video player and appended "Collin giving Trevor a blowjob on grass". The original timestamp remained at the start of the filename</p>
			<p>Collin opened the next file - an image. It showed the same scene. Collin closed out of the image viewer and appended the same text.</p>
			<p>The next image was a video of Collin in doggy position on that table in the backyard, being fucked by Justin. He didn"t remember the video being taken. Trevor"s torso moving up and down on the left side of the video. Towards the end it showed that Trevor was riding Lucas. Collin appended "Justin fucking Collin on table, Trevor riding Lucas on couch".</p>
			<p>The next image was a high-up angle of Collin"s butthole. This was taken just after he had sex with Justin. There was a bit of Justin"s cum leaking out of it. He appended "Collin"s butthole".</p>
			<p>The next image was of Trevor"s butthole, from when he was sort of airating it. It was gaping. Collin could see a tiny bit of the pink intestines inside of it. He appended "Trevor"s butthole".</p>
			<p>The next image was Justin"s butthole, taken in Collin"s room. Collin remembered Lucas taking this picture. It was a great picture. It showed Justin"s bubble butt perfectly. Collin remembered being inside it, and how good that felt, especially with others watching. He appended "Justin"s butthole".</p>
			<p>The last image was of Collin fucking Justin. Justin was in the same position as the last picture. Collin had no knowledge of this picture being taken, and loved that. His pelvis had some slight motion blur. He appended "Collin fucking Justin".</p>
			<p>All seven files had now been renamed. He leaned back in his chair. Collin had posted dick pics before, but he never had porn made of him in an identifiable way like this. Even weirder, he liked it. Sharing his body. He got aroused. He got an erection.</p>
			<p>Collin had gotten in the habit of reliving arousal with Lucas. He locked his computer and went to go find him.</p>
			<p>Collin found Lucas in his bedroom. He was doing something on his phone.</p>
			<p>"I sorted all the photos."</p>
			<p>"Oh cool," Lucas turned to face Collin, "can I see them?"</p>
			<p>"You gave them to me."</p>
			<p>"I didn"t really look at them. And I wanna see how you sorted them." He paused, "We can take care of that after," Lucas nodded at his erection.</p>
			<p>Lucas quicky finished up a bit of whatever he was doing. The two headed back to Collin"s bedroom. Lucas sat on Collin"s bed.</p>
			<p>Collin unlocked his computer and the two went through the photos and videos.</p>
			<p>"Are you comfortable with having these?" Lucas asked eventually.</p>
			<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
			<p>"Are you comfortable with having pictures taken of you having sex?"</p>
			<p>"I guess I like it."</p>
			<p>"Really?"</p>
			<p>"I mean, I"m not <em>uncomfortable</em> with them existing or anything."</p>
			<p>"Would you be uncomfortable if they were on the Internet?"</p>
			<p>Collin shrugged.</p>
			<p>"Sorry," Lucas realized how that might"ve been interpreted, "this isn"t a ploy to get you to do porn with me or anything."</p>
			<p>"I just don"t really know."</p>
			<p>Lucas nodded, "Honestly, I probably wouldn"t be comfortable myself."</p>
			<p>Collin tilted his head.</p>
			<p>"It"s more personal than the stuff I usually do. I don"t like the idea of Internet randos jacking off to personal relationships."</p>
			<p>"But you"re fine with them jacking off to you body?"</p>
			<p>"Was that a rhetorical question?"</p>
			<p>Collin shrugged.</p>
			<p>"I guess it"s that personal relationships are a lot more special than our bodies. Think about it. Everyone has genetalia and the same other bits that everyone else does. I don"t have any tattoos either. But my relationship with you, nobody else has that."</p>
			<p>Collin blushed. Lucas giggled.</p>
			<p>"Yeah like, "Everybody Poops"."</p>
			<p>Lucas didn"t follow.</p>
			<p>"The book," Collin specified.</p>
			<p>"Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Haven"t read it in a decade."</p>
			<p>There was a bit of silence.</p>
			<p>"I"ve <em>eaten</em> your poop." Collin said.</p>
			<p>"You have."</p>
			<p>"It tasted horrible."</p>
			<p>"I bet."</p>
			<p>The two smiled at each other.</p>
			<p>"You know," Lucas said, "I haven"t seen <em>you</em> poop."</p>
			<p>Collin shruged, "...do you want to"?</p>
			<p>Lucas shrugged back, "Kinda."</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>Lucas shrugged again, "Why not? And I"d love to take any opportunity to get more familiar with your body"</p>
			<p>That was good enough of argument for Collin. They might as well.</p>
			<p>"Alright," Collin said, "Let"s do it."</p>
			<p>"You"re ready right now?"</p>
			<p>"I think so."</p>
			<p>Collin assumed they would do it in The Porn Room. Lucas didn"t correct him as he walked the short ways down the hallway.</p>
			<p>"Do you wanna like, eat it?"</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>"Do you want to record it?"</p>
			<p>"Do you want me to?"</p>
			<p>"Sure, why not?"</p>
			<p>Lucas set up the recording. It was just a few short clicks to get the cameras running.</p>
			<p>"So what do you want me to do?"</p>
			<p>"Just poop on the floor, in a position where I can see it." Lucas sat on the floor</p>
			<p>Collin got in doggy about three feet away from Lucas"s face. "That"s good," he said. Lucas had an excelent view of Collin"s butt.</p>
			<p>"So I just, poop?"</p>
			<p>"Yep."</p>
			<p>Collin did so. After about ten seconds, a steady stream of stool started coming out of his anus. His stool made a bit of a hollow-like muted splat when it fell onto the wood flooring. Lucas pleasured himself.</p>
			<p>Collin pushed as hard as he could. There was no reason to hold back. He was empty in less than twenty seconds.</p>
			<p>Collin could only remember pooping somewhere that wasn"t a toilet once before. In the middle of the woods. It was an hour away from the closest bathroom by foot, and he <em>really</em> had to go.</p>
			<p>"You done?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"Yep."</p>
			<p>Lucas got behind Collin and promptly inserted his erection into Collin. He thrusted with a primal volition Collin hadn"t seen before. Collin loved it. He really felt naked. Felt human.</p>
			<p>Lucas finished up quickly. He released inside Collin. He sat back as soon as he was done.</p>
			<p>Collin basked in this feeling. The closest descriptor he could come up with was "violated", but he definitely didn"t feel that way. He felt really good. Relieved.</p>
			<p>Collin peed. The releif showed itself more. Lucas pushed his foot against Collin"s left butt cheek. He played with Collin a bit.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>A week or so passed with nothing happening. It was the week before midterm week. Lots of studying. The group didn"t have many classes together this year, either, so they didn"t really study together.</p>
			<p>The group of six friends met for lunch at their usual table. Luckily, they all had the same lunch period again this year, despite Trevor and Olivia being one grade below the other four.</p>
			<p>Collin was clothed that day. He dressed up well, wearing cute button down with a white denim jacket, [clamp] earrings, and a relatively invisible shade of lipstick. Very gay. He had to catch up on something during lunch so he couldn"t play outside, thus he didn"t need to undress. Olivia was clothed too. Lucas was wearing his boxers as always.</p>
			<p>Trever did his usual burrito routine, and everyone else who brought lunch ate their brought lunch. They fell into conversation quickly. It bounced around from topic to topic. No one person could keep track of where it was going. No one person could hold the conversation either, they all got interrupted with bites of their lunch.</p>
			<p>The time went by fast and soon everyone but Collin went outside. He barely remembered that Justin invited everyone over after school.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Lucas had something to do after school. Collin didn"t really catch what but it had to have taken up his entire evening, otherwise he"d be here. Jessica didn"t make it either. So that left Justin, Collin, Olivia, and Trevor. The two siblings, Justin and Olivia, were sitting across from each other. Collin was to Justin"s right.</p>
			<p>Justin/Olivia"s house was the second best house to meet at after school. Their mother traveled for work. Their dad worked an afternoon-evening shift.</p>
			<p>They hung out in Justin"s room. Olivia had undressed at lunch to play outside. Collin had undressed so he wasn"t the only one clothed.</p>
			<p>Justin got a joint from somewhere, along with a lighter and a very clean glass ashtray. Collin rarely did drugs. He drank maybe once a month. The last time he got high was about three months ago, give or take.</p>
			<p>Olivia piped up, "Remember the time you came in front of us, Justin?"</p>
			<p>"Actually no, I forgot, thank you for reminding me."</p>
			<p>"You"re welcome."</p>
			<p>The joint had gone around the circle and reached Collin. He took a very large hit. It agitated his lungs. He hated smoking. He tried to hold it in as long as he could but had to cough it out. It had a really strong flavor. It was kind of sweet too, maybe a bit fruity.</p>
			<p>"What strain is this?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"I actually don"t know," Justin said, "let me look."</p>
			<p>He grabbed the container that he threw on his bed. "It"s called Desert Sherbet." He pulled his phone out of his backpack. Strain names are federally regulated. This makes it really easy to look up information about the strain such as THC content, effects, and genetic ancestry. There are serious penalties for misrepresenting a strain. If the offense is bad enough, whole companies can be shut down. Dispensaries may breed their own strains but they may only be referred to by a random number until a new strain name is approved.</p>
			<p>Justin read off some of this information. "It was bred in Arizona. Hybrid strain.... About 15% THC content... About 3% CBD content... Citrus flavor... Most reported effects are euphoria and friendliness."</p>
			<p>Collin never experienced much difference in effect between strains, but he didn"t have much of a sample size, nor did he take a large dose when he did weed. He <em>maybe</em> noticed that he felt a bit more tired than when he smoked another, but nothing outside of that.</p>
			<p>"I actually <em>had</em> forgotten about that," Justin said, "Jacking off in front of you. It was a while ago."</p>
			<p>"It was nine months ago," Trevor said.</p>
			<p>"Like I said, a long time." The joint got back around to Justin. He took another hit and set it in the ashtray in the middle, "A lot"s changed since then." Justin looked at Collin.</p>
			<p>Collin shrugged. A lot <em>had</em> changed since then. He started being naked in public [quite] regularly. He had had sex a LOT with a lot more people then he would"ve expected. He moved out over the summer.</p>
			<p>"Do your parents know about anything?" Trevor asked, as if he was reading Collin"s mind.</p>
			<p>"Some stuff I think."</p>
			<p>"What sort of stuff?"</p>
			<p>"Well, when I moved in with Lucas, my dad asked me if I was interested in him."</p>
			<p>"What"d you say?"</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>"You lied?" Olivia interjected.</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>"Aren"t you two like, boyfriends?" Trevor asked.</p>
			<p>"Not that I know of."</p>
			<p>"You"re not interested in him?"</p>
			<p>"I wasn"t at the time, at least romantically."</p>
			<p>"Are you now?"</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>Justin cut in, "Do they know you go nude?"</p>
			<p>"I don"t think so."</p>
			<p>"Well, how could they know?"</p>
			<p>"They met Lucas before I moved in."</p>
			<p>"Was he clothed?"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"Well then how would they know?"</p>
			<p>Collin shrugged.</p>
			<p>"Have they said anything to you?" Olivia asked.</p>
			<p>Collin shook his head.</p>
			<p>"Changed their behavior?"</p>
			<p>He shook his head again.</p>
			<p>"So how would they know?"</p>
			<p>"I dunno, I just feel like they do."</p>
			<p>Olivia tilted her head, "Are you parinoid?"</p>
			<p>Justin cut in again, "I think we should change the subject." Collin was thankful for this.</p>
			<p>"Why don"t we play "Truth or Dare" again?" Justin suggested.</p>
			<p>"You just wanna jack off in front of us again that much again, huh?" Olivia said.</p>
			<p>"You wish."</p>
			<p>Lucas and Collin laughed. Olivia definitely did NOT. She snarled at Justin. Like an actual snarl.</p>
			<p>"So," Justin repeated himself, "should we?"</p>
			<p>Everyone slowly agreed. Olivia was the last.</p>
			<p>"Alright," he said. Everyone knew the rules. The asking power goes to who was asked last time. You can ask anyone, not excluding the person who asked you. "Collin," he said, "truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"Are you interested in Lucas?"</p>
			<p>"Romantically? Only slightly. Sexually? Of course."</p>
			<p>"Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Let me write my name on your butt."</p>
			<p>"Starting out strong." she said sarcasticly</p>
			<p>He shrugged.</p>
			<p>"There"s a sharpie in my room, let me get it." Olivia left the room.</p>
			<p>The weed was already starting to affect Collin. He was very sensitive to it. One thing with smoking is that it acts very quickly. It usually hits within five minutes. It wasn"t a bad sensation, but a pretty powerful one. Collin made a mental note to not take any more for the time being.</p>
			<p>Olivia came back quickly. She handed the sharpie to Collin and stood, on he knees, facing away from him. Collin wrote his name on her left butt cheek along with a heart. He handed the sharpie back to her when he was done. She went back to where she was sitting.</p>
			<p>"Trevor, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Touch yourself until you get an erection."</p>
			<p>Trevor complied immediately. No comments or complaints about the very forward question in round three. Olivia obviously wasn"t fucking around. Or maybe that was her goal (literally).</p>
			<p>Trevor extended his legs out in front of him and started masturbating. Collin was actually disappointed at how little he was enjoying the sight. It was beautiful, watching this cute boy pleasure himself, but he had seen it before. He didn"t get hard. Trevor, on the other hand, was hard in thirty seconds.</p>
			<p>"Justin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"Who was the last person you had sex with except for anyone in this room and Lucas?"</p>
			<p>"Joesph, about a month ago."</p>
			<p>Collin remembered a guy named Joseph from school. He was pretty cute. That was probably him.</p>
			<p>"Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Kiss my penis," Justin spread his legs a bit.</p>
			<p>She leaned forward and gave his crotch a tiny peck.</p>
			<p>"Collin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Get an ice cube and hold it against your crotch until it melts," she motioned her head at the door.</p>
			<p>Collin got up and went downstairs. He got two ice cubes from the dispenser (they dispensed at the same time). He threw one in the sink and headed back upstairs. Once he was sat back down he held it just right of his genitalia between his shaft and scrotum. It was really cold. It quickly numbed the area, and got it wet.</p>
			<p>"Trevor, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"How old was the oldest person you had sex with?"</p>
			<p>"In their mid forties."</p>
			<p>The weed just hit Collin. It was pretty sure. He definitely shouldn"t take more. The others have, but mostly it just sat smoldering in the ashtray, radiating an ever slight bit of heat.</p>
			<p>"Justin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"What"s your most unusual fetish."</p>
			<p>"Incest."</p>
			<p>"Wait, what?" Olivia said.</p>
			<p>"Incest."</p>
			<p>"Yes I heard you. I"m sitting right here."</p>
			<p>"So what"s the question?"</p>
			<p>"You like incest?"</p>
			<p>"Yes that"s what I said."</p>
			<p>"Do you want to have sex with me?"</p>
			<p>"No double dipping!"</p>
			<p>Olivia sighed.</p>
			<p>"Collin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"If you could only have sex with one person until you die, who would that be?"</p>
			<p>Collin hesitated to answer, "That"s a tough question."</p>
			<p>"It"s meant to be."</p>
			<p>Collin took a deep breath, "probably Lucas."</p>
			<p>"Why?"</p>
			<p>"He"s versatile."</p>
			<p>"Experience or position?"</p>
			<p>"Yes."</p>
			<p>"Fair enough," Justing laughed.</p>
			<p>The ice cube was about half melted now. It was going fast.</p>
			<p>"Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Put my jacket on." Collin had tossed it into the corner where is backpack on when he undressed. He grabbed it and gave it to Olivia, who put it on. It covered her breasts but not the middle of her chest.</p>
			<p>"Justin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"I dare you to tell me if you want to have sex with me."</p>
			<p>Everyone but her had an objection to that dare. It was a truth question in disguise. Obviously against the rules everyone silently agreed on.</p>
			<p>"You"re not going to let me do it?"</p>
			<p>Justin shook his head."</p>
			<p>"Okay, okay. I dare you to wear a butt plug for the rest of the game."</p>
			<p>Justin sighed. He got up and went into his bathroom. He came back with a small, clear butt plug. He sat down and curled back his legs. Collin was super turned on at the sight of Justin"s hole. The weed was making him horny. Any weed made him horny. Justin pushed the plug in slowly. He returned to a sitting position when he was done.</p>
			<p>"Trevor, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Jack off to completion."</p>
			<p>Trevor blushed a little bit before continuing. His erection had only died down a little bit. He spit in his right hand and started stroking his shaft.</p>
			<p>If Collin wasn"t turned on before he definitely was now. He developed an erection of his own. It sat straight up. He watched Trevor. It was beautiful. He moved his pelvis to complement his strokes. He made little pleasure noises. He gave no thought to the people watching him. Collin aways admired Trevor"s ability to fully enjoy his body. He was never shy about it. It was beautiful. Of course there was a time and place to be sexual, but he never held back when it was.</p>
			<p>He finished quickly. He ejaculated onto his belly. "I"m gonna go get a towel," he said. He went into the bathroom. Collin stared at Trevor"s butt as he walked away.</p>
			<p>Trevor kept the towel over his crotch when he sat back down. "Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth."</p>
			<p>"Have you had sex with your brother?"</p>
			<p>"No."</p>
			<p>"Collin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Wear Justin"s butt plug."</p>
			<p>"The one he"s wearing?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"Yep."</p>
			<p>The ice cube had fully melted, but the area was still cold and wet.</p>
			<p>Justin curled back to take it out. He held it by the base. It was a little shiny. Collin curled up his legs the same way Justin did to insert it. It was warm.</p>
			<p>"Trevor, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Post a dick pick online."</p>
			<p>Trevor got his phone out of his backpack. He moved the towel off his crotch and took a picture of it. He then made a few taps. A few moments later he showed the group the picture. It was posted on Reddit in r/penis. It was titled "My softie"</p>
			<p>"Collin, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Finish in me."</p>
			<p>Collin giggled, "You"re still horny?"</p>
			<p>"A little, and I"m high."</p>
			<p>Collin couldn"t say no. Not that it was against the rules of the game, but Collin <em>really</em> liked the idea of fucking Trevor.</p>
			<p>Trevor rotated around to doggy. Collin got behind him. He carefully penetrated him. Collin leaned forward above Trevor and made vertical thrusts. He wrapped his left arm around Trevor"s torso. The two had a lot of skin contact.</p>
			<p>Olivia hadn"t actually seen Collin have sex before. She"d watched Justin top her boyfriend once, and had pegged Trevor, but she hadn"t seen Collin. She had an idea what the boys got up to, though.</p>
			<p>After about a minute, Collin climaxed, and as per his dare, finished inside Trevor.</p>
			<p>Collin pulled out and sat back down where he was. Trevor, on the other hand, crawled back to where he was and then stayed belly down, with his butt up in the air. He laid his head on his arms and rested his eyes. He was still hard. Trevor did this all the time. It supposedly brought his top"s cum further inside him.</p>
			<p>From Collin"s view, Trevor"s butt made a cute heart shape. He wanted to fuck it, even though he just did that.</p>
			<p>"Justin," Collin started, "truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Truth"</p>
			<p>"Do you want to have sex with Olivia?"</p>
			<p>"...Fuck." Justin said under his breath. He forgot about that line of questioning.</p>
			<p>"Answer it..." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Justin almost started to speak, "...Yes? But not in the way you might think."</p>
			<p>"What does <em>that</em> mean?" Olivia shouted.</p>
			<p>"I want to have sex with you but not... <em>you</em>." he used both hands to vaguely point at her.</p>
			<p>Trevor chimed in "It sounds like you wanna have sex with her."</p>
			<p>"I mean in a sense of not her specifically. She"s pretty and that"s pretty much the extent of my attraction."</p>
			<p>Olivia laughed, "You"re fine bro. Just messin with you."</p>
			<p>Justin sighed in frustration, "Collin, truth or dare."</p>
			<p>Collin couldn"t decide which was worse. He decided on "Dare."</p>
			<p>"Drink my pee."</p>
			<p>"Okay," Collin said.</p>
			<p>"You better not get any on my carpet." Olivia said.</p>
			<p>Justin stood on his knees and Collin sat on his feet. He put Justin"s dick in his mouth. Justin only peed about half a glass worth of urine. It was quite potent. Collin winced while he drank it up. The two sat back down when they were finished.</p>
			<p>"Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
			<p>"Dare."</p>
			<p>"Have sex with me."</p>
			<p>Trevor immidiately laughed. Collin shortly after.</p>
			<p>Olivia groaned, "I"m done after this..."</p>
			<p>"That"s fair," Justin said.</p>
			<p>Olivia leaned back and got in missionary. Justin got on top of her. Trevor opened his eyes to watch.</p>
			<p>Justin penetrated Olivia vaginally. He quickly got to work.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Each person took a long shower. Collin and Olivia went first. Collin used Justin"s shower, who stayed to finish off Trevor.</p>
			<p>Collin sobered up pretty quickly. That tends to happen with smoking too, at least with him. He felt comfortable enough to drive home. He still took his sweet time in the shower, though. Justin had to pound on the door to get him to come out. Olivia offered to have him for dinner, but he agreed with Lucas to come back for dinner tonight.</p>
			<p>Lucas was in the kitchen cooking something good when Collin got back. He was wearing an apron. He cooked nude <em>once</em> when he was a kid. He"s never made that mistake again.</p>
			<p>"That smells great." Collin said, huggin him from behind.</p>
			<p>"It <em>is</em> great." Lucas said. He turned his head to peck Collin"s chin.</p>
			<p>"What happened to your outfit?" he asked. Collin hadn"t dressed back up.</p>
			<p>"I took it off."</p>
			<p>"Why? You looked so cute. And gay."</p>
			<p>Collin leaned against Trevor"s body more. His hands explored downwards. He kissed Lucas"s ear, jaw, and cheeks. "You know why."</p>
			<p>"Did you have fun?"</p>
			<p>"Of course."</p>
			<p>"Who"d you fuck?"</p>
			<p>"I topped Trevor. Justin fucked Olivia, and Trevor too."</p>
			<p>"Olivia?"</p>
			<p>"Yep."</p>
			<p>"Did both of them want it?"</p>
			<p>"It was a dare by Justin."</p>
			<p>"That checks out."</p>
			<p>"Hey," Collin stepped back a little bit, "what do you think our relationship is."</p>
			<p>Lucas briefly made eye contact with Collin, "why do you ask?"</p>
			<p>"There were a few questions about it tonight. I"m curious to see what you think."</p>
			<p>"How would you define it?"</p>
			<p>"Friends with extra benefits."</p>
			<p>Lucas nodded, "that"s about how I would describe it," Lucas made and kept eye contact with Collin, "unless you want it to be more?"</p>
			<p>Collin shrugged, "I"m fine where it"s at. I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page."</p>
			<p>"Are you uncomfortable giving me affection?" Lucas asked in the most respecting way he could.</p>
			<p>"Nope. Just wanted to check in."</p>
