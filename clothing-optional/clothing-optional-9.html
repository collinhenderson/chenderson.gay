			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 09 - Lucas</h1>
			<p>This chapter includes the following uncommon themes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scat</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places, and it is somewhat expected for no clothing to be worn in certain places/activities such as swimming and sports. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town. Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href="mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>

			<h2>An Apology</h2>
			<p>I would like to apologise for the terrible quality of this story, both in the fact that I forgot to change the strawpoll results from the story before it, and my terrible grammar and sentence structure. I have seen my readership drop off lately and would like to see that improve. I will read over each new story several times to make sure it's up to my quality standards. I have updated this story to make it better, however it will still not be up to my quality standards. Again, apologies to both my readers and the Nifty archivist.</p>
			<h2>Warning</h2>
			<p>This story contains randomly generated phone numbers. This may or may not be someone's real phone number, please do not spam it.</p>
			<h2>Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>Lucas sat down in the chair next to Collin, and put his backpack on the table. Collin looked over at Lucas. "Hey." he said. Lucas was a Hispanic boy that was about 5'4", one of the shortest boys in the grade. Lucas was wearing only a pair of boxers that were tight, but comfortable.</p>
			<p>Collin knew Lucas; he was on Justin's soccer team. He has talked to him several times, and saw him at some of Justin's birthday parties many times. Lucas usually wore a pair of boxers to school, but often went naked when he felt like it. Nudity is required to play on any official sports, and Lucas always undressed when he went outside to practice extra during lunch.</p>
			<p>"Hey." Collin said.</p>
			<p>The two were grouped together for a history project. The entire class was grouped at random in pairs to write a paper on a random one of thirty important figures in history. "Who did we get?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"Kennedy" Lucas said.</p>
			<p>"Neat" Collin said just to say something.</p>
			<p>The assignments were handed out at the end of the class, or at least essentially the end. "Do you wanna come to my house and work on this at 7? I have practice until then."</p>
			<p>"Sure." Collin said. "Alright, what's your number?" Lucas asked, getting his phone out of his backpack. "707 927 4512" Collin said, slowly. Lucas clicked "save" on his phone, then scrolled to another contact and clicked a few things. Collin's computer showed a notification of a new text: a csv file. Collin clicked on the notification, then on the file. A contact with Lucas' name, picture, email, phone number, and address showed up in a new window. Collin clicked "add to contacts".</p>
			<p>The class started to pack up its things "Call me when you get to my house." Lucas said. Collin stood up and put his laptop in his backpack. "OK." He said.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Collin drove to the side of the road, and put his car in park. Lucas lived in a row house in the more urban part of the town. Collin turned his car off and grabbed his backpack. Collin put his keys in his backpack, grabbed his phone, and called Lucas. "Hey" Lucas said when he answered the phone. "I'm here." Collin said, as he got out of the car and walked towards the door on the left side of the house. "Alright I'll be down." Lucas said, and hung up.</p>
			<p>Collin put his phone back in the mesh water bottle holder on his backpack, then put the other strap on. Collin got to the door just as Lucas opened it. Lucas stepped to the side to let Collin through. Lucas was naked. Collin took off his shoes (as well as his socks to match) when he was inside. "Do you own this?" Collin asked, as he slid his shoes under the bench.</p>
			<p>"Renting it, yeah." Lucas said.</p>
			<p>"It's very nice."  Collin remarked.</p>
			<p>"Thank you." Lucas said.</p>
			<p>Lucas could best be described as "cute". He has a 5" long uncut penis, almost no body hair, petite feet, warm brown skin, and a tight butt that was shaped like a perfect circle. He was short enough that he looked almost chubby, but was most certainly not; he also had a deeper than average voice.</p>
			<p>"How do you afford it?"</p>
			<p>"What do you mean?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"How do you pay for this? This place has got to be at least $1700 a month, and the UBI is $1500 so how do you afford it?"</p>
			<p>"I do web development." Lucas said.</p>
			<p>"Neat." Collin said. The two walked into the open living area in the back of the house. The kitchen was on the left, with a living area in the middle, and a dining room on the right.</p>
			<p>"You looking to move out?" Lucas asked. "What?" Collin asked. "Are You moving out?" Lucas said again, "It was just a guess. You suddenly started going naked at school - I just assumed that you might not like being with your parents."</p>
			<p>"Good guess." Collin said.</p>
			<p>I try to." Lucas said.</p>
			<p>"Where do you wanna work?" Lucas asked. Collin looked around the living area, "Anywhere." he said. "Do you want something to drink?" Lucas asked. "Sure." Collin said, sitting down on the couch. "Any preference?' Lucas asked. "No." Collin said, getting out his laptop. "Are you okay with alcohol?" Lucas asked. "Yeah sure." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Collin put his laptop on the coffee table and started it up. The screen lit up with a Dell logo, and then a Ubuntu one. A box then popped up asking for a password to unlock the internal drive, Collin typed it in, the computer started up.</p>
			<p>Lucas came back with two glasses of wine. He walked around the right side of the couch, set one glass on the right side of Collin's laptop, and kept the other in his hand. Lucas sat down next to Collin.</p>
			<p>Collin's laptop got to the login screen, he moved his laptop onto his lap, and logged in. "What's your internet?" Collin asked, navigating to something on his screen. "password is password" Lucas said. "That's not a very good password." Collin said, looking Lucas dead in the eyes. "No that's the name." Lucas reiterated. "Oh." Collin said, and selected the network. "What's the password?" Collin asked. "L0ctITEW" Lucas spelled out. Collin clicked enter, and sipped his wine while he was waiting for his laptop to connect. The dialog box disappeared, which meant the laptop was connected. Collin opened up a word processor, and typed "Kennedy Paper Ideas" for the title.</p>
			<p>"I think that we should do something about the cold war." Lucas said. "What specifically?" Collin asked. "Probably Bay of Pigs. I don't want to do anything super obvious - its the lesser of the two main events." Lucas suggested. "That actually sounds pretty good, do you want to go with that?" Collin asked. "Sure." Lucas said. Collin deleted the document's title, and then typed "The Bay of Pigs Invasion".</p>
			<p>Collin opened Firefox, a DuckDuckGo search window showed up. Collin typed "Bay of Pigs" and clicked enter. Collin started to sift through the results for sources and ideas on what to write. Lucas leaned in to look at the screen, "I think we should write about the environment and theme of proxy wars as a whole." Lucas suggested, "Maybe," Collin said, "Isn't the whole assignment supposed to be about a single event?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah but we can add context." Lucas compromised. "Yeah, sure." Collin said, "Why not."</p>
			<p>Collin kept looking through search results, he dragged one so it opened in a new tab. "That one about the imprisoned exiles' letters looks interesting." Lucas said. Collin dragged that one to a new tab as well. Lucas leaned closer to Collin, which caused him to get an erection. He was quite aroused being naked in close proximity to someone he found attractive - Collin still hadn't fully adjusted to nudity. Collin noticed, and guessed that Lucas would prefer that he ignore it.</p>
			<p>Lucas still addressed it, "You okay?" he asked. Lucas was still leaning in to see the screen, so Collin could smell Lucas' breath. "Yeah, I'm fine." Collin said. "Am I sitting too close?" Lucas read Collin like a book. Collin gave Lucas a look, "Sorry, man, reading people is kinda my thing." Lucas said. "I can tell." Collin said. "But are you okay?" Lucas asked. "Yeah, I'm fine." Collin said, moving his butt forward on the couch so his erection was in the more comfortable position resting against his body.</p>
			<p>Collin continued to look through the search results.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>"You got an erection in front of him!" Justin exclaimed.</p>
			<p>"I know I was there." Collin said.</p>
			<p>"What happened?"</p>
			<p>"We kept working." Collin answered, "It didn't seem to bother him."</p>
			<p>Justin moaned in pleasure. Trevor was on his knees in front of the couch giving him a blow job. "Keep going. i'm almost there." Justin said, like that would change what Trevor was doing.</p>
			<p>The three boys were hanging out at Trevor's house as they do on a Saturday.</p>
			<p>"Do you know he does porn?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>"No, I did not." Collin answered. "Wait, is 'web developer' a cover?"</p>
			<p>"No." Justin answered; he orgasmed. Trevor swallowed Justin's cum. "Wanna see some?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>"Sure." Collin answered.</p>
			<p>Trevor moved back to the couch in between Collin and Justin; Justin reached for his phone on the coffee table, opened up Safari, then typed in a link to a Pornhub user. "Oh, he's live." Justin said, and pulled up the stream. Justin cast the video onto the TV in front of him. The TV rapidly turned on and started playing the video. The video showed Lucas with his chest down on the left side of a nice bed. His legs were on the floor with his feet spread out, giving the steam a beautiful view of his hole. His penis was pointed down at the ground.</p>
			<p>"So this is live?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"Yeah," Justin said, "and with 15 thousand viewers."</p>
			<p>"He's that popular?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah." Justin said. "He gave me his URL a few months ago. He's been doing it for almost a year now."</p>
			<p>Collin put his right arm around Trevor, who leaned into him. "The page says 'tip to turn on butt plug'," Justin read. "It's 5 dollars a minute. Should I tip?"</p>
			<p>"If you want." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Justin typed "/tip 250" into the chat. "Okay I bought 30 seconds." Justin said. A buzzing sound came from the TV, Lucas moaned.</p>
			<p>Collin moved his right hand down to Trevor's genitals and started to play with them. "It also says 'the longer it goes the faster it gets.'" Justin said.</p>
			<p>"Tip more of you want." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Justin decided he would, and typed "/tip 1000" into the chat.</p>
			<p>"Okay I just got another 2 minutes." Justin said.</p>
			<p>"That's twelve and a half dollars." Collin said the obvious. "I know." Justin said.</p>
			<p>Collin started to get hard watching Lucas and pulled Trevor up on top of him. Collin's penis pushed into Trevor's crack, which was warm to Collin. Trevor then lifted himself, grabbed Collin's penis, and put it inside of him.</p>
			<p>Trevor did his best at staying out of Collin's view of the stream by turning slightly to the right, so that his body was kind of to the left. Collin started guiding Trevor up and down as he focused on the stream. The intensity of the butt plug's vibration increased, Lucas moaned again. Collin forced Trevor all the way down on him, making Trevor moan, but then returned to guiding him up and down, but slightly more violently, pretending that Trevor was Lucas. Lucas moaned for a long time, and turned his head sideways to compensate for the sensation.</p>
			<p>Collin was amazed - Lucas was a boy he had wanted to fuck for years. Collin had jacked off to a photo of him probably hundreds of times. The photo was a yearbook of Lucas; he was laying belly down on the soccer field, looking up and smiling at the photographer; the angle showed a bit of his hole and his balls, but a more direct angle would give a perfect view - not that he would care. He was in uniform which was just two pieces of fabric around each arm that had the players' number on them. It was one of his favorite photos, but for "almost a year" he could have just watched porn of him, which is better.</p>
			<p>Collin started to move Trevor faster - though he wasn't really focused on Trevor, mainly Lucas. Collin reached a beautiful climax just as the intensity of the butt plug increased again. He released his load inside Trevor, and rested him on his lap.</p>
			<p>Lucas was moaning and almost wailing until he himself climaxed and let out a loud pleasurable moan. He ejaculated all over the bed sheets and the ground below. Collin started to play with Trevor's genitals again.</p>
			<p>The butt plug kept vibrating for another thirty seconds. Trevor got off Collin, grabbed a towel from the coffee table, and set it on his seat before sitting down. Collin did not clean himself yet.</p>
			<p>When the plug stopped, Lucas clicked a button on his phone, which closed tipping. He then pooped out the butt plug, which landed on the hardwood floor out of frame, and then started to poop. Collin stroked his persistent boner as a consistent stream of dark brown stool pushed its way out of Lucas's anus and landed on the floor below.</p>
			<p>"Is he gay?" Collin asked. "I have no idea, he never told me." Justin said, "but he mainly does gay porn. He might be bi."</p>
			<p>Collin watched Lucas in awe "Do you think he'll do something with me?" Collin asked. "Probably, yeah." Justin said. "As long as it is porn and not just sex in private. You should ask him."</p>
			<p>"Really?" Collin asked, "Yeah." Justin said, "I asked him when he told me, we've done a couple videos together. My face was blocked, of course. He might do the same for you."</p>
			<p>"How?" Collin asked, "Show me."</p>
			<p>Justin stopped the stream, and navigated around a bit, before casting a video to the TV. The video showed what looked like Justin's body with a thick piece of fabric over the face, laid out on the same bed that was in the stream from the same angle. Justin skipped to the middle of the video, which had a more intimate angle of Lucas reverse-cowgirling Justin. "He does this exact kind of thing with nearly everyone, including girls, it's his signature. Trevor stroked himself to the video.</p>
			<p>"Have you done porn before?" Justin asked. "I posted a few dick pics on Reddit when I turned 18." Collin said. "Do you want to do this?" Justin asked. "I think so." Collin answered.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Collin walked up to the door, which Lucas immediately opened. Collin walked in and took off his shoes. "Same place as yesterday?" Lucas asked. "Sure" Collin agreed. Once Collin had fully finished taking off his shoes, Lucas walked the same way to the couch. Collin followed shortly behind. The two boys sat down in the same order. Collin got out his laptop and booted it up, a few seconds later Collin logged in, and opened Firefox.</p>
			<p>"Can I do porn with you?" Collin bluntly asked. He figured there was no reason to wait. Lucas looked Collin in the eyes, "Sure." Lucas said. Collin felt butterflies wash over his body. "Who told you? Justin?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"Yeah Justin." Collin answered. "He showed me your stream today. He was the one who donated enough to make you finish." Collin said. He locked his laptop and set it on the table in front of him. Collin turned his body to face Lucas, who turned to face him.</p>
			<p>"Yes, I'm bi." Lucas said. "How are you so good at guessing what I'm thinking?" Collin asked. "Well I've suspected you've had a crush on me a few times, and you essentially told me you were attracted to me yesterday."</p>
			<p>Collin felt ashamed, and then quelled it down a little bit by telling himself that there was no reason to be ashamed. Collin felt comfortable, intimate; he got an erection. Lucas looked at it for a half second then looked back at Collin's eyes, "Can I touch it?" Lucas asked. "Sure." Collin said. Lucas moved as close to Collin as he could, and put his right hand around Collin's penis. It was very hard, and throbbing, Lucas slowly stroked it, and got an erection as well. Collin looked down at it and- "Go ahead." Lucas said. Collin put his right hand around Lucas' penis, and started to lightly stroke it as well. Collin played around with it for a few moments before Lucas started talking again: "Do you want to go do it now?" Lucas asked about the porn. "Sure." Collin said. Lucas stood up, breaking away from Collin's grasp, "Come on." Lucas said, walking back the way he came.</p>
			<p>Collin stood up and followed Lucas up a set of stairs, down a hallway, and into a room. It was the same room that Collin had seen in the stream. The room was made to look like a bedroom,  but was much larger, much more bright, and had three cameras pointed at the bed in angles familiar to Collin. There was a desk with a computer on it which controlled the cameras and the lights, and managed the recordings. Right next to the door was a sign that said "Nudity required".</p>
			<p>"Welcome to my porn room." Lucas said. He sat down at the desk and typed away at the computer, "Don't worry about getting anything messy, I clean up afterwards." Lucas said. "I figured - I watched you poop on a live stream" Collin said. "Oh yeah, right." Lucas said. "What do you wanna do?" Lucas asked, opening a program from a shortcut. Collin was still just in the door looking around the room, he was very nervous. Once Lucas had finished setting up for the recording, he walked over to Collin, "Are you alright?" Lucas asked, "Yeah I'm just," Collin had difficulty describing what he was going through, "kinda going through culture shock.</p>
			<p>"We don't have to do this." Lucas said. "No I want to." Collin said. "You're just not used to this level of openness?" Lucas asked. "Yeah that's it." Collin said.</p>
			<p>"What do you wanna do?" Lucas asked. "What you did with Justin." Collin said. "I guessed as much. Do you want your face covered?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"Yes." Collin said.</p>
			<p>"Okay." Lucas said, "I need to grab some things and prepare a bit." Lucas said, as he pulled a piece of cloth out of a container on one of several of those square shelf things. Lucas handed the cloth to Collin, "Lay down face up on the bed, and drape this over your face." Collin took the cloth and did as told. Collin still had a massive boner.</p>
			<p>"Don't take off the cloth until I tell you to." Lucas said, then started recording. He walked over to the bed, and got in position above Collin, whose penis was twitching in anticipation. Lucas grabbed Collin's penis, and aligned it with his hole. Lucas slowly lowered himself onto Collin's Penis. Collin penetrated Lucas.</p>
			<p>Lucas started to move up and down. Collin got a boost of adrenaline. Lucas felt very nice, his anus was lubricated, and his insides were very tight. Lucas moaned a little bit as he went lower. Collin breathed a bit harder.</p>
			<p>Lucas tried to focus on pleasuring himself, he closed his eyes a few times, and moved in different patterns. Collin orgasmed, and came inside Lucas, but since Lucas wasn't finished, he kept going.</p>
			<p>Lucas went down lower, almost four inches in. He went in a circular motion, up and back, forward and down, up and back, forward and down.</p>
			<p>Collin felt good again, like he was about to orgasm again. He tried to subtly thrust into Lucas by moving his hips up and down, but Lucas' motions made it difficult for Collin to orgasm again.</p>
			<p>But Collin eventually did orgasm, about ten seconds before Lucas did, whose cum sprayed all over Collin's chest, onto the cloth covering his face, and the bed.</p>
			<p>Lucas rested all the way down on Collin, and moved his pelvis back and forth for a little extra pleasure.</p>
			<p>Lucas eventually stopped and pulled off of Collin. He walked over to the computer and clicked on the "stop recording" button. "You're clear." Lucas said. Collin pulled the cloth off of his face and sat up. He looked over at Lucas. He decided to walk over to him. "Did you like that?" Lucas asked. "Fuck yeah." Collin said. Lucas sat down in the chair. Collin leaned on his hands against the desk; he watched Lucas work.</p>
			<p>"Do you want me to get you a towel?" Collin asked; fluids were leaking out of Lucas onto the chair, "No, I like this." Lucas said. The cum on Collin was starting to flow down him and onto the floor.</p>
			<p>Lucas dragged some video files into an editor, and very quickly started to put a video together. It took less than two minutes before Lucas got to exporting the video. The window that popped up said "Approximately 15:24 remaining". Lucas opened a drawer to his right, and plugged it into the computer. He copied a folder called "Premium Sets" and the raw footage that was just recorded onto it. "I'm going to give you some photos of me as payment, and the raw footage, and the uncompressed final video. Lucas said. "Thanks." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Lucas got up and went and laid on the bed. Collin laid next to him. "Do you wanna move in?" Lucas asked.</p>
			<p>"Seriously?" Collin asked.</p>
			<p>"As long as you pay rent, yes. I have an extra room, and  I won't force you to do porn or anything, but of course you can if you want."</p>
			<p>"I'll think about it." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Lucas turned on his left side and faced Collin, who did the same. Collin was absolutely covered in cum, Lucas used his thumb to collect some and put it in his mouth. The two boys chuckled. "You came a lot." Collin said. "I know, it felt amazing." Lucas said, taking a bit more cum. Collin put his right hand around Lucas, and pulled him closer. Collin felt around Lucas' back, and finally rested his hand on Lucas' butt.</p>
			<p>The two boys looked deep into each others' eyes. "Do you like me?" Lucas asked. "I used to." Collin said.</p>
			<p>Collin kissed Lucas. When the two finished they chuckled again. Collin started to play with Lucas' butt. Lucas started to play with Collin's genitals. The two kissed again.</p>
