			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 04 - Hiking</h1>
			<h2>About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places, and it is somewhat expected for no clothing to be worn in certain places/activities such as swimming and sports. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town.
Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href="mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>Quick Notes</p>
			<p>So when I actually got around to jacking off to my last story, I noticed it was a little dry. I'll definitely take steps to make it a slight bit more raunchy from now on.</p>
			<p>Also, you might be wondering why all of these are in the third person - It's to make it more enjoyable for people of all sexual positions. You'll get it if you read this.</p>

			<p>Of a random roll from 1 to 117, I rolled an 29, meaning that the decided answer is "Hiking".</p>
			<h2>Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>It had been almost three weeks since Collin had first gone naked at school, and he had yet to be caught. Collin had gone naked to school a total of seven times ever since. "Do you guys want to do something tonight?" Justin asked the group. "whman amhbhmimp manmmmamm aum meape" Trevor said, chowing down on his burrito. "What?" Jessica said. Trevor swallowed, "What about taking a hike?" he restated.</p>
			<p>"Eh..." Olivia responded.</p>
			<p>"The beach?" Justin suggested.</p>
			<p>"Eh..." Olivia responded. "We can hang at my house and play video games or something."</p>
			<p>"Eh..." Trevor responded.</p>
			<p>"What about a movie?" Jessica suggested.</p>
			<p>"Eh..." Collin responded.</p>
			<p>All five paused for a second. "Are all of us even available today?" Collin asked. Everyone looked around as everyone else silently said, "yes". "Okay," Collin started back up, "then what do we do?"</p>
			<p>"Wanna flip a coin to decide?" Justin asked everyone. Everyone silently agreed. Justin got a random coin out of his backpack. "Heads is for hiking or the beach, tails is for video games or a movie." Justin set. He flipped the coin and caught it, then flipped it onto the back of his hand, "heads" Justin said, looking at the result. He flipped the coin again using the same method. The other four looked in anticipation as the sound of Justin slapping the back of his hand rang loudly around the table before mixing in with the noise from the rest of the cafeteria. "Heads" Justin said, looking at the coin.</p>
			<p>"So we're hiking." Collin said, which everyone knew already. "Where do we go?" he asked. "What about the one up north?" Olivia suggested, "We could go through the woods and then take a walk on the beach as well, and maybe swim?"</p>
			<p>Everyone silently agreed again.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Collin's car turned off the second he turned the key counter-clockwise, took it out, and put it in his backpack. Jessica parked to the left, and Justin to the left of them. Olivia grabbed her backpack and stepped out of the car and left Collin to his own devices. Collin quickly undressed, set his clothes on the passenger seat, and threw his clothes on the passenger seat. Collin quickly stretched in his seat, then put his shoes back on. Collin grabbed his backpack, slung it around his right shoulder, and got out of his car to catch up with his friends. Collin slammed the door behind him, and locked his car with the fob. Collin put his keys in his backpack, and sped walked toward everyone while he adjusted his backpack.</p>
			<p>"You ready?" Olivia asked Collin. "...Yeah..." Collin said, not making sure he had everything. "So, where are we going?" Justin asked. "Just down to the beach and then around and back up." Collin said. "Unless anyone wants to do more." he suggested.</p>
			<p>Everyone silently agreed to not do more.</p>
			<p>"Okay cool." Trevor said, since someone had to break the silence. Trevor took the lead, and started into the woods on a twenty-foot long concrete path that only existed to establish where the trail was. The rest of the group closely followed. The group walked through the dry heavy woods for about ten minutes in an awkward silence that nobody wanted to break - they all enjoyed it. "What are you guys doing for that history thing?" Trevor asked, breaking the aforementioned silence. "I don't know yet, I need to like, randomly choose something, there's to much of a time-frame." Olivia said. "I'm doing the French Revolution." Justin chimed in. "Original..." Trevor turned around to respond, before turning back to continue walking forward.</p>
			<p>The group continued in silence for yet another ten minutes, just before they came to a sort of rest stop on a cliff overlooking part of the very long stretch of beach that extended out past visible distance.</p>per
			<p>The rest stop had a bathroom and several benches. "Oh, good, I gotta use the bathroom." Jessica announced for some reason, and headed off into the bathroom. The other four headed over to the benches on the beach-ward side of the trail. Collin and Justin sat on the one to the left, with the perspective of facing towards the ocean, Trevor and Olivia sat on the right. "I love Fridays" Collin stated. The sun glared into his eyes. "This is nice." Trevor remarked. "Collin, are you enjoying this?"</p>
			<p>"Liking what, the hike or being naked?" Collin lead the question.</p>
			<p>"Both." Trevor said.</p>
			<p>"It's nice. And <i>really</i> cold." Collin answered. "As expected." Justin said.</p>
			<p>The group looked out at the ocean for a couple minutes.<p>
			<p>Jessica came back from the bathroom and sat next to Justin. "Are we gonna sit here a while?" Jessica asked like she was talking to one person. "I don't know, we can probably go if you want to, we were just waiting for you." Justin answered. "Alright, let's go then." Jessica commanded. Everyone got up, put their backpacks back on if they had one, and continued down the trail in the same order. They still didn't say a word. About fifteen minutes down, they reached a fork in the trail, the left path went down to the beach, and the right one continued straight on the cliff.</p>
			<p>"Oh, can we go to the beach?" Jessica asked the group. "I brought three towels." "What, why?" Olivia asked Jessica. "Because I wanted to go to the beach." Jessica answered. "Do you just have towels in your car or something?" Olivia kept asking questions. "Yeah, why?" Jessica answered.</p>
			<p>"I wanna walk more." Collin said. Everyone kind of didn't say anything for a while. "I kinda do too." Justin said, making up his mind. Everyone else's silence meant that they sided with Jessica.</p>
			<p>"You can go down at the next one, it's just a half mile or so down. Then you can walk back and find us." Trevor suggested.</p>
			<p>"Sure." Collin adopted. Justin agreed as well. "Alright," Justin said, "Text us if the plans change."</p>
			<p>"Okay." Jessica agreed.</p>
			<p>Collin and Justin started walking down the same trail as the other three headed down to the beach. The two boys walked in silence for about five minutes. "Do you like someone?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>Collin looked slightly up at him, "Why... Why is that the first thing you ask?" he said.</p>
			<p>"I don't know if you do, and I was thinking about it. No specific reason" Justin replied, while turning his head to look back at Collin.</p>
			<p>"No," Collin answered, "I don't."</p>
			<p>"Ah, okay." Justin said.</p>
			<p>"Do you?" Collin asked. "No," Justin said, "I'm not too into dating and stuff."</p>
			<p>"Are you gay?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>There was a pause, "Yeah," Collin said.</p>
			<p>"Neat." Justin said, "Does anyone else know?"</p>
			<p>"No. Collin said.</p>
			<p>"Neat." Justin said.</p>
			<p>The boys kept walking. Their footsteps were quiet in the dirt, but still very noticeable due to the absence of other sounds. "Have you ever had sex?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>"No." Collin answered. "Have you?"</p>
			<p>"A few times. Mostly with Trevor." Justin said.</p>
			<p>"You've fuck Trevor?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah, every once in a while." Justin said, "In total about, eight times?"</p>
			<p>"Nice." Collin said. The boys kept walking, passing various people, until they hit the next path down to the beach. They followed each other down the path, which still went north perpendicular to the shoreline, then turned south just before getting to beach level. Collin started walking down the beach before getting stopped by Justin sitting down on a rock, stretching his legs. Collin walked back and joined him. Justin was taking his shoes off now that they were walking in the sand. Collin followed suit.</p>
			<p>Justin sighed. "Do you wanna mess around or something?" he casually suggested. "Here?" Collin asked. "Yeah, why not?" Justin said back.</p>
			<p>Collin looked at Justin. "Whaaat?" Justin asked, in a low-pitched voice. "Nothing," Collin replied, "I'm just not, used to the openness of you guys. My parents have always been quite conservative."</p>
			<p>"Can you blame them?" Justin asked, "No," Collin agreed. "They were like, 12 when the first law went into place. "It seems forever to us, because it has been, but it's different for them." Justin looked at Collin, "You'll get used to it eventually."</p>
			<p>"So," Justin continued, "Do you wanna mess around or something?" Collin thought about it for a hot second, "Yeah, sure." Collin answered. "Oh, wow," Justin cut in, "You actually agreed. I did not expect that." Collin looked back into Justin's eyes, "Seriously?" Collin said. "Yeah, I mean." Justin said, motioning towards Collin's body. Collin understood that Justin wasn't talking about his body, but about how he was not as outgoing as Justin. "Yeah." Collin agreed.</p>
			<p>"Sooo..." Collin asked, "What do I do?" "Whatever you want." Justin said. "Nobody will bother us here, Trevor and I come here all the time. "That doesn't help." Collin said - Justin knew why. "Well, if you want you could blow me, or I could fuck you, or the other way around if you really want." Justin suggested. "I'll... blow you." Collin chose. "Okay." Justin had no problem with that. Collin set his backpack down on a flat section of the rock behind him, Justin didn't have one.</p>
			<p>Collin hesitantly got on his knees a couple feet in front of Justin on the sand. Collin sat on his feet.  Justin stretched his feet out on either side of Collin, giving him a great view of Justin's newly erect penis, and his naturally hairless balls that hung very close to his body. Collin looked up at Justin. "Obviously," he started, "you don't have to if you don't want to." "No I want to, I'm just... I don't know." Collin said. Not wanting to explain what he meant, because nobody knew what he meant, Collin leaned his face into Justin's crotch area.</p>
			<p>Collin put his weight on his left arm as he briefly jacked Justin off to get a feel of him. Collin's own penis was fully erect and he could feel it's weight. Collin put the tip of Justin's cock in his mouth, and moved his tongue around it. He played with the meatus a bit. Justin grabbed Collin's hair and gently forced him down. The way he was positioned, Collin's butt was open, and he could feel the burning sun and the cold air on his hole, he was slightly discomforted by it, but enjoyed it.<p>
			<p>Collin slowly went up and down Justin's shaft, after a few seconds of this, Justin felt a great moment of pleasure, and let out a moan to match. Justin put his right hand on Collin's smooth back. and eventually reached all the way down and grabbed a handful of Collin's right butt cheek. Collin started jacking himself off, the slight bit of sand stuck on his hand was rough, but it was still, overall, net pleasurable. Justin moved his hand to the left, and started to rub Collin's hole.</p>
			<p>Without any warning, Justin shot into Collin's mouth. This scared Collin, who pulled back from Justin's dick, but was then met with another shot right below his nose. Collin quickly put his mouth on Justin's dick and drank the rest of his cum.</p>
			<p>Collin then sat back on his feet, as Justin removed his hand from Collin as slowly as possible, and started to jerk off, looking right into Justin's eyes. Justin slowly jacked <i>himself</i> off as he waited for the end to his show.<p>
			<p>After a moment, Collin orgasmed, and leaned his head back. Collin stopped jacking himself and aimed his dick at Collin. The first shot from Collin went so far, it landed right on Justin's belly. The second landed on the rock, and then the rest on the sand and Collin's hand.</p>
			<p>Collin and Justin stared at each other for a while. Collin embraced the feeling of Justin's cum running down his face.</p>
