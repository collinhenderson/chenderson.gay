			<h1>Clothing Optional - Chapter 03 - School</h1>
			<h2>About this series</h2>
			<p>This is a series set in an alternate society where clothing is optional, in basically all places, and it is somewhat expected for no clothing to be worn in certain places/activities such as swimming and sports. This series follows a gay teenager (named Collin because that's my name), who has friends of both genders, and various sexualities, living in a Northern California Coastal town.
Even with its non-sexual base, this series is still very sexual, and very inappropriate; and is therefore only for mature audiences.</p>
			<p>At the end of the story there will be a link to a Strawpoll or two, which contains a question that will decide something small in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>I happily take any feedback and suggestions at <a href=
mailto:collin.henderson@protonmail.com">collin.henderson@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>Strawpoll Results</h2>
			<h3>Boy Preference</h3>
			<p>After 48 hours of voting time, Justin won with 88 votes (59.86%), Trevor got 59 votes (40.14%). I will prefer Justin.</p>
			<h3>Should Collin go naked at school?</h3>
			<p>After 48 hours of voting time, There were 180 "yes" answers (89.55%) and 21 "no" answers (10.45%). Of a random roll from 1 to 201, I rolled an 8, meaning that the decided answer is "yes". The roll for weather or not he will be caught has already been done. The results will not be revealed in the next story.</p>
			<h2>Start of Chapter</h2>
			<p>The sun was attacking Collin, or at least that's how he saw it. He contemplated what to do. He wanted to, of course <i>someone</i> will ask questions, but the biggest risk was being caught by his parents. The NPR announcer playing in the background suddenly became the target of his worry - he violently shut off the stereo. He immediately regretted his decision as the sound of the car, its engine, and the blasting AC dug into his skin.</p>
			<p>But his suffering was almost done. He turned into the parking lot of his school, and parked near the back.</p>
			<p>Actually, his suffering wasn't done.</p>
			<p>Collin turned off his engine, and leaned his seat back, then leaned back in his seat. Collin took off his seat belt, then put his palms flat against his face and then rubbed his face.</p>
			<p>Collin let out a pathetic groan, and then almost defeated, moved his seat back all the way. It took forever, the electric seat hummed quietly for about ten seconds until the seat was as far back as it could go.</p>
			<p>Collin took off his t-shirt. and threw it in front of the passenger seat, then his belt. He carefully untied his shoes and set them to the side to put on later. Collin paused for a hot few seconds before taking off his pants and underwear, also throwing them in front of the passenger seat. Collin humbly put back on his shoes, and sat in his seat for a bit. He was, for the first time in almost a year when he went swimming in the ocean with his friends, Collin was naked in public - or almost in public.</p>
			<p>Collin grabbed his backpack and slung it over his right shoulder as he grabbed the keys out of the ignition, and stepped out of his car. Collin locked his car with his key fob and dropped his keys on the ground as he tried to put them in his pocket.</p>
			<p>"Fuck." Collin said as he bent down to pick them up, and then put them in his backpack. Collin put his left arm through his other backpack strap and held onto the straps with his hand as he walked to the nearest entrance to the school. He became nervous as he crossed that mini road between the parking lot and the school. A naked boy, probably a freshman, walked in just before of him.</p>
			<p>Collin walked through the quickly closing door that the boy had opened, and walked into a wide hallway with students walking from place to place and getting things from their lockers. Collin did some quick calculations and determined that Trevor's locker was the closest to him, and he would most likely be there at 8:40 like he always is. Collin walked down a hallway, and down another noticing people ignore him, except for the few that noticed the absence of his tan. He stopped at Trevor's locker, and like Collin had guessed, Trevor was at his locker. Collin stood behind him and looked down at Trevor. Because of the way he was sitting on his feet, Collin could just quite see up his crack at his tight little-" "You know I can see you back there." Trevor cut off Collin's Thoughts. Trevor quickly looked at Collin. "You did it." Trevor remarked, "I'm actually surprised."</p>
			<p>"Me too." Collin replied.</p>
			<p>"Everyone else is hanging in the library." Trevor said, expecting Collin to come. Tyler shut his locker, put the lock back on, and stood up while putting his backpack on. Collin stared into Trevor's eyes as he adjusted his backpack, "What?" Trevor said. "I don't know," Collin replied, "It's just, weird being naked for the first time in a while."</p>
			<p>"You'll get used to it" Trevor said, which didn't really calm Collin because Trevor couldn't speak from experience. "Come on." Trevor motioned his head back to where Collin came from, and started walking that way. Collin followed Trevor to the library and to their regular table where Justin, Olivia, and Jessica were all killing time on their phones or computers. They all saw Trevor sit down and looked up at Collin. "Fuck." Justin said, and handed Jessica a $5 bill as Collin sat down. "You bet on it?" Collin asked both Jessica and Justin. Both looked at him without responding.</p>
			<p>"How does it feel?" Olivia asked.</p>
			<p>"Cold," Collin listed, "and I have butterflies in my stomach."</p>
			<p>"Congratulations?" Olivia said to Collin.</p>
			<p>"What?" Collin questioned.</p>
			<p>"I don't know," Olivia started to clarify, "This is a new thing for you, and I feel like you deserve some kind of a 'congratulations' or 'good job' or <i>something</i>."</p>
			<p>"Are you nervous?" Justin asked.</p>
			<p>"Oh yeah, big time.</p>
			<p>"Don't be, nobody will really care. If anyone looks at you it's probably because of your tan."</p>
			<p>Collin looked around the library. About two thirds of the people he saw were naked, and nobody was looking at him. "That didn't really help." Collin said to Justin.</p>
			<p>"It will eventually." Justin assured.</p>
			<p>Collin pulled his phone out of his front backpack pouch, and opened up Threes. Collin started swiping on his screen to play the game. "Did you bring your clothes in your backpack?" Trevor asked. "No, they're in my car." Collin responded. "I'm gonna go the full day at least." Trevor didn't reply and started to do something on his phone. Collin locked his phone and put it in his backpack, and then slung it around his shoulder. "I gotta go to the bathroom, then I'm gonna go to class." Collin announced, as he started to walk to the bathroom. "Yeah me too." Justin said, as he closed his laptop lid and walked to the bathroom just behind Collin. The bathroom was just behind a set of bookshelves. Collin and Justin both made a beeline to the urinals. Collin grabbed the one closest to the door, and tried to unbuckle his belt before he remembered that he wasn't wearing it. He instead grabbed his penis with the tip of his right-hand fingers, and started to pee in the urinal. Collin looked over at Justin a few urinals over, specifically at his Penis that was since excreting light-yellow urine. Collin looked back forward as he finished, and then shook his penis to get rid of any straggling liquid.</p>
			<p>Both the boys walked right behind them to the sinks, and proceeded to wash their hands. Almost in unison, both of them walked over to the paper-towel dispenser and, as expected, proceeded to dry their hands. Collin was about to leave before Justin stopped him. "Collin, wait!" Justin warned. He motioned towards Collin's crotch, "You should take care of that before class." Collin looked down to see his penis fully erect. He didn't notice in the slightest. Justin walked out of the bathroom.</p>
			<p>Collin sighed, walked to the nearest stall, closed and locked the door, and hung up his backpack on the provided hooks on the door. Collin got out two things - first: his phone from the front pouch he had put it in just a few minutes ago, and second: a small bit of lotion he kept in the same pouch. Collin quietly sat down on the toilet, and set his phone on the top of the toilet paper holder. He swiftly opened the lotion bottle and put a decent amount on his right hand. With his left hand, Collin set the lotion on the toilet paper holder, and grabbed his phone.</p>
			<p>Eager, Collin started rubbing himself as he unlocked his phone and navigated to an album in his photos titled, "I don't know what to call this." There were about twenty or so photos in the album, he scrolled through slowly until he saw one that piqued his interest. He tapped on the photo, which was an image taken by yearbook which showed a naked Justin dribbling a soccer ball down a grass field.</p>
			<p>Collin started to rub himself faster. Justin was looking off into the distance for someone to pass the ball to. The sun shined on Justin's front, his muscles and shape cast a shadow on himself. The angle was perfect for both a view of his fat penis swaying with his movement, as well as the shape of his butt. Collin let his imagination go wild. He imagined Justin forcing him down in the middle of the field, he imagined him fucking him, cumming in him. Collin zoned out as he finally orgasmed. Collin came all over his chest. Collin continued to rub himself even after he finished cumming.</p>
			<p>Eventually, after an undetermined amount of time, Collin stopped rubbing himself, and began to clean himself up using toilet paper. He was very thorough because if he missed any, people would be able to see it. Collin quickly washed his hands, then returned to the stall to pack up his things, then proceed to leave the bathroom. Collin pushed the door open and was suprised to find Justin waiting for him just next to the door. "You waited for me?" Collin remarked. "Yeah, don't really want anyone to walk in on you." Justin explained.</p>

			<p>The decision in the second poll will be calculated like a weighted lottery. If choice A has 80% of the votes and choice B has 20%, choice A has an 80% chance of winning and B has a 20% chance.</p>
